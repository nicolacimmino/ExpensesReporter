This is my first attempt at an Android application, so I am focusing more on learning and figuring out all the needed tools. the application itself doesn't have a general public interest as it is a simple expenses report integrated with my personal intranet.

The application has a simple input interface that I have kept to a minimum as it will be ofter used while on the move, for instance just after purchasing something in a shop. 

User can also get a list of expenses, this is a very simple list for now with no filtering nor sorting.
